              <h3>Challenge:</h3>
              <p>
                Between 2012 and 2024, little progress was made in making
                processes for complying with tax obligations in Mexico more
                digital. As part of the presidential initiative to simplify
                official procedures, it was proposed that the SAT's (Servicio de
                Administración Tributaria) online site be reviewed and
                redesigned to make it easier for new taxpayers to register.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="grid__item">
              <h3>Outcome:</h3>
              <p>
                A new landing page aimed at streamlining registration for new
                users and help them find the most appropriate regime according
                to their economic activities, while avoiding causing additional
                friction for users who are already familiar with the current
                portal.

              <h3>Research:</h3>
              <p>
                Initially, a diagnosis of the available site was performed.
                Following work meetings with personnel from the Secretaría de
                Hacienda, it was identified that new taxpayers were experiencing
                difficulties with registration and understanding the benefits
                and obligations of the available tax regimes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, the fragmented nature of the information across
                many microsites made navigation complex, with duplicated and
                sometimes outdated or contradictory information. As part of an
                internal SAT initiative, the number of entries was cut from
                around 800 to 200 by eliminating duplicate and outdated records.

              <h3>Insights:</h3>
              <p>
                Due to time constraints, the process did not include research
                conducted directly with users of the platform. Instead, it
                started from the analysis conducted by the Tax Administration
                Service's design and communication team, orienting the design
                towards two potential user profiles.

              <h4>Identified issues:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Problematic information hierarchy.</li>
                <li>Unintuitive Iconography</li>
                <li>
                  The layout of the elements on the screen was prone to
                  overflowing.
                </li>
                <li>Lack of accessibility for users with disabilities</li>
                <li>
                  Lack of visual unity with other Mexican government portals.
                </li>

            <p>
              Given the limited time for the generation of the solution, a
              medium fidelity prototype was proposed, incorporating an
              interactive and granular questionnaire that would allow users to
              identify a regime suitable for their economic activities
